My first project in SEI course from GA. [PLAY MY GAME!](https://pages.git.generalassemb.ly/fidaa/Project-1-Tic-Tac-Toe/)

Create a simple Tic Tac Toe game with two players that could be launched online through the browser!
![XO](https://cdn0.iconfinder.com/data/icons/dottie-game/24/game_029-tic_tac_toe-xo-entertainment-play-512.png)

* The game is played on 3x3 grid.
* Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
* The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
* The game ends in a tie, if no player has 3 marks in a row.

## Requirements:
* Switch turns between X and O.
* Visually display which side won or draw.
* Render a game board in the browser.
* Should have three files HTML(for page structure), CSS(for styling the page and make it attractive), and JS(for logic and DOM manipulation).
* Involve Audio in your game.
* Allow players to customize their tokens.
* Keep track of multiple game rounds with a win counter.
* A landing page
